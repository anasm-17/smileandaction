## Detect and perform action
This code recognizes a particular emotion and sends a print command to the default printer.

## Deep Learning Model

The model used is from this [research paper](https://github.com/oarriaga/face_classification/blob/master/report.pdf) written by Octavio Arriaga, Paul G. Plöger, and Matias Valdenegro.
